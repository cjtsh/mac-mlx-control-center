## 🌟 Why macOS MLX Control Center?

Most local LLM runners are either overly complex, hog system menubars, or require manual hand-editing of configuration JSON files for coding tools. **macOS MLX Control Center** solves this with:

* 🔄 **One-Click Harness Sync (v0.8.4)**: every installed model is written into your DeepSeek Harness `mlx-local` provider by a single button (or `./mlx.sh sync-harness`) — no hand-editing YAML, no retyping repo ids.
* ⚡ **Fast, Resumable Downloads + Optional HF Login (v0.8.0)**: Large models now download over **8 parallel HTTPS range requests** instead of one throttled stream (measured on this line: 74 KB/s single connection → **2.2 MB/s** with 8), with byte-accurate progress, real MB/s, ETA, a **90-second stall watchdog** that restarts dead transfers automatically, and a **"🤗 Sign in" button** that uses HF's device flow so each user authorises *their own* account — the token goes into the macOS Keychain, never into this repo.
* 💾 **Multi-Drive Model Libraries (v0.7)**: Every writable APFS/HFS+ drive is discovered automatically and each one becomes a model library at `<drive>/MLX-Models/hub`. Pick a **Download to:** drive in the toolbar or per model with the **💾 Save to…** button, keep 70–100 GB models off your boot SSD (pick a drive, confirm, then it downloads), and see a live per-drive inventory (models, free space, offline drives) on the Downloaded Models tab. Includes a free-space guard, absolute-path launching, and the `./mlx.sh drives` / `./mlx.sh use-drive` / `./mlx.sh download <repo> --to <drive>` CLI. Add `--turbo` to force parallel mode, or `--no-turbo` to use the plain client.
* 🎛️ **Combinable Search Filters + Any-Bit Quant (v0.6)**: The `⚡ MLX Models`, `👁️ Vision & Multimodal` and `💻 Code Models` chips are independent toggles that combine with AND, and a new **Quant** dropdown filters by **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 or 16-bit** (instead of 4-bit only). Stack them with the RAM budget: *"MLX + Code + 8-bit + Fits My Mac"* in three clicks.
* 🧠 **Accurate RAM Estimates & RAM Budget Filter (v0.5)**: Search cards now show real weight sizes and parameter counts pulled from Hugging Face (`safetensors` blobs + `safetensors.total`) and estimate RAM as `weights × 1.06 + KV cache + 1.5 GB`. A new **RAM Budget** dropdown (Fits My Mac / 8–192 GB / Any Size) hides models that can't run on your Mac, with 🟢/🟡/🔴 fit badges and Smallest/Largest RAM sorting.
* 👁️ **Vision & Multimodal Image Recognition (v0.4)**: Full native integration with `mlx-vlm`! Run Gemma 4, Qwen 2.5/3.8 VL, PaliGemma, Pixtral, LLaVA, SmolVLM, and more with full image analysis, OCR, visual question answering, and chart understanding.
* 🖼️ **Interactive Vision Test Chat (v0.4)**: Upload and preview images directly in the GUI test bench to test OpenAI-compatible multimodal payloads.
* ⚙️ **Dual-Engine Auto-Detection (`mlx-vlm` + `mlx-lm`) (v0.4)**: Automatically detects model architectures and chooses the optimal inference engine without manual flags.
* 🔌 **LibreChat & Coding Agent Multi-Modal Sync (v0.4)**: Direct compatibility with LibreChat (`host.docker.internal:9999/v1`), Pi Code, and OpenCode for image recognition and coding workflows.
* 🧠 **macOS Memory & Process Manager (v0.3)**: Real-time visual breakdown of Apple Silicon Unified Memory (App, Wired, Compressed, Available Cache) with an interactive top process scanner (`🔍 Manage RAM`) and 1-click process termination to free up memory for larger models.
* 🔤 **Model Sorting & Date Added (v0.3)**: Sort local and downloaded models by Name (A-Z / Z-A), Size (Largest / Smallest), and Date Added (Newest / Oldest) with exact timestamps on all model cards.
* 📱 **Horizontal List Mode vs. Card Mode (v0.3)**: Toggle seamlessly between sleek horizontal list rows and spacious square card grid views across all model and search views.
* 🟢 **Activity Monitor-Aligned RAM Accounting (v0.3)**: Accurate unified memory metrics matching Activity Monitor, `htop`, and `mactop`.
* 🚀 **1-Click Model Launching & Hot Swapping**: Instantly switch between MLX models without terminal commands.
* 📦 **Multi-Quant & Subfolder HF Support**: Direct support for repositories with multiple quantizations (e.g. `orcarouter/Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored-MLX/tree/main/4-bit`). Pick exact bit precision (`2-bit`, `4-bit`, `6-bit`, `8-bit`) and download only the weights you need instead of 80+ GB!
* 🌐 **Supercharged Hugging Face Search**: Search thousands of model weights directly with **combinable filter chips** (`⚡ MLX Models`, `👁️ Vision & Multimodal`, `💻 Code Models` — click several, they AND together), a **Quant** selector (2/3/4/5/6/8/16-bit), and sorting (`Most Downloads`, `Most Liked`, `Recently Updated`, `Smallest / Largest RAM First`).
* 🤖 **Built-In AI Model Comparison Engine**: Select 2 to 4 models to generate an instant technical breakdown comparing quantization precision (`2bit-DQ`, `OptiQ-4bit`), RAM compatibility, and specialization — *works 100% locally out-of-the-box with zero API keys or accounts required!*
* 🟢 **"Can I Run It?" Apple Silicon RAM Calculator**: Live color-coded RAM budget badges (`🟢 Fits Smoothly`, `🟡 High RAM Pressure`, `🔴 Swap Danger`) computed against your Mac's actual available memory.
* 🤖 **Auto-Sync Pi Code & OpenCode Agents**: Automatically configures [Pi Code](https://github.com/) and [OpenCode](https://github.com/) under provider `MyMac` (`http://127.0.0.1:9999/v1`). Whenever you swap models in the GUI, your coding agents automatically route to the newly loaded model!
* 📊 **Tokens/Second Speed Benchmark**: Measure generation speed (`tok/s`), execution time, token counts, and GPU memory usage on Apple Silicon.
* ⚙️ **Custom API Settings**: Change default ports (`9999`, `8888`, `8080`), host binding (`127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0` for LAN access across home Wi-Fi), and max output token budgets with built-in memory guidelines.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Running local AI on your Mac has never been easier. You only need:
1. **Any Mac with Apple Silicon M-Series Processors** (with Unified Memory).
2. **macOS** (12.0 or newer).
3. **Python 3.10+** (pre-installed on macOS or available via Homebrew/Xcode).

> *Note:* Dependencies like `mlx-lm` and `hf` CLI are automatically installed on-demand via `uvx`. You do not need to pre-install heavy ML environments! Zero API keys or account sign-ups are required.

---

## 🖥️ Terminal CLI Mode

Prefer working in the terminal? You can also use `mlx.sh` directly:

```bash
./mlx.sh
```

### Key CLI Commands:
* `./mlx.sh list`: View all downloaded local models and RAM sizes.
* `./mlx.sh search <query> [ram_gb] [tags] [quant]`: Search Hugging Face repositories directly from terminal (e.g. `./mlx.sh search qwen 32` shows only models that fit in 32 GB; `./mlx.sh search coder 32 mlx,code 4` adds the combinable tags and 4-bit quant filter; prompts for anything omitted).
* `./mlx.sh drives`: List every model-library drive (free space, model count, Time Machine state, default target).
* `./mlx.sh protect-models`: Exclude every model library and the HF cache from Time Machine backups.
* `./mlx.sh use-drive [name]`: Change the default download drive (`./mlx.sh use-drive NVMe`).
* `./mlx.sh download <repo> --to <drive> [--turbo|--no-turbo]`: Download straight to a specific drive (`--to` is optional; you get a drive menu instead). `--turbo` forces the 8-connection parallel engine, `--no-turbo` disables it.
* `./mlx.sh login` / `./mlx.sh whoami` / `./mlx.sh logout`: Sign in to Hugging Face with the device flow (token stored in the macOS Keychain), check who you are, or remove the token.
* `./mlx.sh start`: Interactive launcher with Fast Swap and Concurrent port options.
* `./mlx.sh stop`: Emergency kill-switch for running servers.

## 🎛️ Combinable Search Filters & Quant Selector (New in v0.6)

The old chips were **presets**: clicking `👁️ Vision & Multimodal` replaced `⚡ MLX Models`, so "MLX vision models" was impossible, and `🎯 4-Bit Quantized` was hard-wired to one bit width.

Now the chips are **toggles** and every filter combines with AND:

| You want | Click |
|---|---|
| MLX models only | ⚡ MLX Models |
| Vision models that run in MLX | ⚡ MLX Models + 👁️ Vision & Multimodal |
| 8-bit coding models for your Mac | ⚡ MLX Models + 💻 Code Models, **Quant: 8-bit**, RAM Budget: Fits My Mac |
| Everything on Hugging Face | 🌐 All HF Repos (clears every chip) |

The **Quant** dropdown accepts **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 16-bit**. Matching uses the repo name first (`-4bit`, `q8`, `8-bit`) for instant narrowing, then the repo's real `config.quantization_config.bits` once sizes arrive, so quantization-in-config repos are filtered correctly too. The header line tells you the active combination, e.g. `Filter: MLX + CODE + 4-bit`.

CLI equivalent: `./mlx.sh search <query> [ram_gb] [tags] [quant]`, e.g. `./mlx.sh search coder 32 mlx,code 4`.

## ⚡ Fast, Resumable Downloads (New in v0.8.0)

Downloading a 70–100 GB model used to mean watching a progress bar that lied. Three things were wrong, and v0.8.0 fixes all of them.

**1. One stream is throttled to a crawl.** Measured from this machine: a single HTTPS connection to the Hub sustains **74 KB/s**, while **8 parallel range requests reach 2.2 MB/s** (16 → 1.6 MB/s, 32 → 2.4 MB/s, so the line peaks around 2.3 MB/s ≈ 19 Mbit/s). The bottleneck is per-connection shaping, not authentication and not `hf_transfer`. So for any model with LFS blobs over 256 MB, the downloader now splits each file into 8 ranges, fetches them concurrently into `blobs/<sha256>.parts/`, verifies the **sha256 published by the Hub**, and only then moves the blob into place — after which `hf download` links the snapshot instantly instead of re-downloading it.

**2. Dead sockets never died.** The Hub client has no stall watchdog: when a transfer stalls, the process stays alive at 0 B/s forever. A watchdog now samples progress every 10 seconds; after **90 s with no byte growth** it kills the stuck process tree and relaunches the same command (up to **3 attempts**), then reports `STALLED` instead of pretending to download. `hf` resumes from its `.incomplete` files, so nothing is re-fetched.

**3. Progress was guesswork.** Speed is now a rolling 15-second window and ETA is derived from it, updated per poll. Turbo transfers publish their own status file (`~/.mlx_pids/turbo/<id>.json`), so the dashboard shows real bytes during the parallel phase, then `FINALISING` while the hub links files.

### Signing in to Hugging Face (optional, credential-free by design)

This repository ships **no tokens and no client secrets**. Signing in uses HF's OAuth **device flow** with a client that is registered dynamically at runtime:

```bash
./mlx.sh login     # prints a code + https://hf.co/oauth/device link
./mlx.sh whoami    # who am I signed in as, and where is the token stored?
./mlx.sh logout    # remove it from this Mac
```

The GUI has the same flow behind the **🤗 Sign in** button in the header, plus a "paste a token instead" fallback for users who already have a fine-grained token. Tokens live in the **macOS Keychain** (`service: mlx-control-center`) with a `0600` file fallback at `~/.mlx_pids/secrets.json` for machines without a keychain; nothing is ever written into the repo, and every code path works anonymously — a signed-out clone still downloads public models, just slower on gated or rate-limited repos.

## 🔄 Sync Installed Models into DeepSeek Harness (New in v0.8.4)

DeepSeek Harness reads its model list from a profile file (`~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/cordis.patch.yml`), one entry per model id. Nothing discovers your local server on its own, so a freshly downloaded model used to mean hand-editing YAML — and because the **desktop** profile only applies patches at startup, getting it wrong is invisible until a restart.

**Settings → 🤗 DeepSeek Harness model list** now shows the state and fixes it in one click:

| State | What it means |
|---|---|
| `3 models listed · 3 installed · in sync ✓` | Nothing to do |
| `2 models listed · 3 installed · 1 downloaded but not listed` | Press **🔄 Sync now** |
| `⚠️ listed but no longer installed` | Entry points at a model you deleted — sync removes it |

What a sync does:

* reads installed models from every library drive (deduplicated, so a model present on two drives appears once);
* rewrites only the `models:` block of the `mlx-local` provider, keeping the rest of your file byte-identical;
* **keeps hand-written labels** for models already listed, and generates readable ones for new repos (`sh0wie/Qwen3.8-...-REAP-288-MLX-4bit` → `Qwen3.8 Flash Next REAP 288 4-bit (MLX)`);
* writes a timestamped backup next to the file (`cordis.patch.yml.bak-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`) before touching it;
* never stores credentials — the provider has no `apiKeyEnv`, so nothing secret enters the profile.

Same thing from the terminal:

```bash
./mlx.sh sync-harness
```

Restart DeepSeek Harness afterwards (the desktop profile loads the file at startup); then pick the model under the **MLX (this Mac)** provider. The model id **must be the Hugging Face repo id**, because `mlx-vlm` treats the request's `model` field as a repository to load — a cosmetic alias like `mlx-local` returns `404 Repository Not Found`.

## 💾 Multi-Drive Model Libraries (New in v0.7)

A 70–100 GB model does not have to live on your boot SSD. **macOS MLX Control Center** turns every writable drive into a model library.

### How it works
* **Nothing to configure.** Every writable APFS/HFS+ volume with at least 8 GB is discovered from the mount table: your boot drive, internal second SSDs, and any Thunderbolt/USB drive you plug in. Time Machine destinations, read-only DMGs (installers like "Install ChatGPT") and tiny volumes are skipped automatically.
* **One folder per drive.** Models are stored in Hugging Face cache layout at `<drive>/MLX-Models/hub/models--org--repo/…`. Your boot drive uses `~/MLX-Models/hub` instead, so the sealed system volume is never touched.
* **Smart default.** External drives win: the default target is the external drive with the most free space, remembered in `~/.mlx_pids/storage.json`. Change it any time with the **Download to:** dropdown next to the RAM Budget, or `./mlx.sh use-drive <name>`.
* **One button, one confirmation.** Every download starts with the single blue **💾 Download…** button: pick the drive (free space, `TM off` state and a `too small for N GB` warning per drive), then confirm — `Download <repo> (~7 GB) to 💾 TBolt-1TB-Fun?` — before a single byte moves. Nothing is written to a drive you did not confirm.
* **Free-space guard.** Downloads are refused with `insufficient_space` (GUI toast / HTTP 409) or a CLI prompt when the target drive is too small — no half-written 100 GB downloads.
* **Absolute-path launching.** A model on an external drive starts as `mlx_lm.server --model /Volumes/<drive>/MLX-Models/hub/models--…/snapshots/<rev>`, so the engine never depends on the working directory.
* **Live inventory.** The Downloaded Models tab shows one line per drive (`💾 TBolt-1TB-Fun: 3 models · 612 GB free`) and every model card is labelled with the drive it lives on. Drives that are unplugged keep their models listed as offline instead of vanishing.
* **Backups stay sane.** Model weights are re-downloadable multi-GB blobs, so they never belong in a backup set. Every library directory (`<drive>/MLX-Models`, `~/MLX-Models`) plus the leftover `~/.cache/huggingface` cache is added to Time Machine's exclusion list automatically (`tmutil addexclusion`) as soon as it exists — including libraries on drives you plug in later. The drive list shows `🚫 TM off`, or a clickable `⚠️ backup on` warning if a drive's library is still inside your backup set. CLI: `./mlx.sh protect-models`.

### Why not `HF_HOME`?
`HF_HOME` is global: it moves *every* model to one place and breaks as soon as you unplug that drive. Per-download `--cache-dir` keeps each model on the drive you chose, and the dashboard keeps track of which is which.

### Drives API
```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9998/api/drives | python3 -m json.tool
# {"drives": [{"id": "<volume UUID>", "name": "TBolt-1TB-Fun", "mount": "/Volumes/TBolt-1TB-Fun",
#              "free_gb": 612.5, "library": "/Volumes/TBolt-1TB-Fun/MLX-Models/hub", "models": 0, ...}],
#  "default": "<uuid>", "default_name": "TBolt-1TB-Fun"}
```

> **Format note:** use APFS (or HFS+) for model drives. exFAT/FAT32 cannot store the symlinks Hugging Face relies on, so those drives are reported but not offered as libraries.

---

## 🧠 Accurate RAM Estimates & RAM Budget Filter (New in v0.5)

Search cards now show **real numbers fetched from Hugging Face** instead of guessing from the repository name:

* **Weight size** — summed from the repo's `safetensors` blobs (picks the largest quant subfolder when a repo ships several).
* **Parameter count** — read from `safetensors.total` in the HF API, falling back to parsing the name (`7B`, `8x7B`, `350m`).
* **RAM estimate** — `weights × 1.06` (activations) `+ KV cache` (`params × 0.02 GB`, clamped 0.75–8 GB) `+ 1.5 GB` runtime overhead.

> **Why this matters:** previously any repo with `4bit` in its name matched the `"4b"` substring and was rated as a 4-billion-parameter model (≈3.2 GB). A 180B-parameter `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-4bit` with **106 GB of weights** showed a green "Fits Smoothly (Est: 6 GB RAM)" badge — it would never load on a Mac.

### RAM Budget dropdown
The search bar has a new **RAM Budget** selector:

* **`🖥️ Fits My Mac (auto)`** — uses *usable RAM* = total unified memory − `max(4 GB, 12%)` reserved for macOS (e.g. **112.6 GB** on a 128 GB Mac).
* **`8 … 192 GB`** — only list models whose estimated RAM fits that ceiling.
* **`Any Size`** — no filtering (sizes and fit badges are still shown).

Badges are computed against the current budget: 🟢 **Fits Smoothly** (≤ 80%), 🟡 **Tight Fit** (≤ 100%), 🔴 **Too Large** (shows required vs. usable RAM). Sort by **Smallest / Largest RAM First** to find the right size instantly.

Sizes are fetched in a fast second pass (`/api/repo_sizes`) and cached, so repeat searches are instant.

## 💡 How Token Limits & RAM Work on Mac

In the **`⚙️ API Settings`** panel, you can configure your **Max Output Tokens**:

* **Max Output Tokens**: Specifies the maximum number of *generated response + reasoning tokens* the server produces. It does not limit your input prompt size.
* **RAM Guidelines for Apple Silicon**:
  * **2B – 8B Models** *(Gemma 4 4B, Qwen 7B)*: Set to `4096 – 8192` (Light KV Cache RAM impact ~0.5 GB).
  * **14B – 35B Models** *(Qwen 32B, DeepSeek 35B)*: Set to `4096` (Moderate RAM impact ~1.5–3 GB).
  * **70B+ Models**: Set to `2048 – 4096` to prevent memory swapping.
